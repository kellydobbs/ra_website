	<p> <strong> Industry: </strong> Food & Beverage &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
		<strong>Methodology:</strong> Online qualitative discussion
<br>
	
<strong> Project:</strong>		  
		Food manufacturer â€“ advertising strategy</p>
	
	
	<h2>Background</h2>		
 <p>In an effort to grow the market share locally, a local potato chip manufacturer partnered with an ad agency to use consumer insights to inform the advertising strategy for the brand. Research objectives were to: </p>

	<ul class="check"> 
		
			<li>	Understand emotive and rational connections to the brand so they can be amplified throughout the target market;</li>
	<li>	Determine occasions that drive purchase, pain points to fulfill the usage occasion, and other experiential aspects of the Client Brand.
</li>
				
	 </ul>





<h2>Approach</h2>	
	
	<p>Once the participants were screened, they were directed to an RAI web-based data collection platform, where they participated in a facilitated discussion that consisted of a series of activities over the course of five days.</p>

	
	<h2>Results</h2>
	
	<p>The client received a wide range of findings, from which, a number of recommendations were made:
		
</p>

    <ol>
			  <li>	Portray friends having a good time in advertising </li>
	  <li>	Highlight the pride that people have for their state in advertising</li>
	  <li>	Emphasize the sense of nostalgia and childhood memories that the Client Brand elicits</li>
	  <li>	Consider updating the packaging, log, and tagline to appear more modern</li>
	  <li>	Increase distribution beyond typical grocery stores</li>
	  <li>Further engage with consumers through social media. </li>    
		
    </ol>
