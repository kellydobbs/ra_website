     and President of Roda Marketing Research, Inc. </p>
     
<p>Marketing Research specializes in healthcare marketing research. Its curated Health Care professional recruiting
 database panels will enhance Research America’s work in healthcare and pharmaceutical marketing research, fostered 
  by its 2016 acquisitions of Viewpoint Consulting, MSP Analytics and Sigma Group. Roda Marketing Research 
  has built extensive panel recruiting databases which include key industry opinion leaders among hospital medical 
  directors, hospital and retail pharmacists, registered nurses across all specialties (including Nurse
   Practitioners), dentists and ophthalmologists. </p>
<p>“Bringing Adele Roda and her marketing research team into Research America is going well. Synergy exists
 between our companies, especially evident through the similar ways we’ve built our client relationships --
  through personal outreach and delivering extraordinary customer service. The foundation Adele has built will
   enhance the work we’re already doing and we are very pleased to have her and her team on board,” commented
    Robert Porter, President of Research America, Inc.  </p>
