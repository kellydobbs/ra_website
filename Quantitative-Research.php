	<h1>Quantitative Research</h1>
	
	
<p>Quantitative research measures attitudes, behaviors, opinions and other variables to formulate facts and uncover patterns. The information is collected from existing and potential customers using sampling methods and sending out surveys, polls, questionnaires, etc., the results of which can be depicted in numerical form.  

</p>

	<p>	The data obtained via Quantitative data collection methods can be used to test existing ideas or predictions, learn about your customers, measure general trends, and it is even possible to predict the future of a product or service and make changes accordingly. 
</p>
	
	<p>Quantitative data collection methods are much more structured than Qualitative data collection methods. As Quantitative data collection methods are often based on mathematical calculations, the data obtained this way is usually seen as more objective and reliable than Qualitative. 
</p>
	
	<p><strong>Quantitative data collection methods include the following:
