<p><b> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 29, 2018. </b> – Research America Inc. earned recognition from three important US business publications during the latter half of 2018, according to Robert Porter, CEO.
</p>
	
     
<p>The company has earned recognition from Inc. magazine's annual List of America's 5000 Fastest Growing Companies.  In addition, the Cincinnati Business Courier and Philadelphia Inquirer have singled-out Research America for recognition as a top marketing research firm in the Cincinnati region; and the Philadelphia Inquirer listing the firm as one of the top 100 growth companies in Philadelphia and southeastern Pennsylvania.
 </p>
	
		
<p>“This recent media recognition highlights what the company has accomplished through building a national brand, while also reflecting the company's impact on the marketing research profession in two large regional business communities,” Porter said.  </p>

	
<p>"I'm proud of the hard work the Research America team has accomplished for our clients during the past three years.  We've worked hard as one team to create systems that deliver knowledge to our clients quickly and accurately,” Porter added.  “Recognition by Inc. magazine, the Cincinnati Business Courier and by the Philadelphia Inquirer along with the Wharton Business School is evidence that what we say we can do is absolutely true:  RAI is an accurate and agile partner in marketing research with our clients."
