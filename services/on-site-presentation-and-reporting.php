	<h1>On-Site Presentation And Reporting</h1>

	<p>In addition to receiving raw data and/or written reports, many clients want a live,
	  in-person formal presentation of final project results to their organization. Research America’s on-site
	  meetings include a step-by-step review of study findings and results, as well as providing an opportunity
	  for direct questions-and-answers. Our expert team of statisticians and analysts are always available to
	  meet in-person and/or prepare formal, oral reports as requested.
	  </p>
 
    
<p class="green-ques">Our reporting delivers answers to these questions:</p>
   
    <ul class="check">
    <li> What does the data really mean? </li>
	 <li>	What impact does it have?</li>
	 <li>	What have we learned from the data?</li>
	 <li>	What action do we take next based on the new information?</li>
	 <li>	How can future marketing research studies be enhanced?</li>
	 <li>	What could make this information more useful?</li>

    </ul>

<p>Presenting information to your company is arguably the most important part of your research program. 
When Research America’s team is invited to deliver an oral report to your stakeholders, your research findings
 will be channeled into a finely-tuned presentation that can be delivered in person, or in a webinar.
  Our analytics team will: </p> 
  
  <ul>
	<li>Draft an Outline of findings for client approval, which will then form the basis of your report 
    and presentation. </li>

	<li>Draft a narrative that will explain why research was conducted, what key information was found, what the findings  mean, and what your organization&rsquo;s management should do next. </li>
     
		<li>	Create Visuals - full-color  graphs and charts with important numbers and findings linked to key  data represented in the Executive Summary and oral presentation.</li>
    
		<li> Draw Conclusions: Research America’s consultant team will bring ideas to the table, advising you
         in how to move forward and act upon research findings. </li>
         
		<li> Bring Copies: The mechanics of every presentation are just as important as its details. During on-site presentations, our presenters will bring projectors (when required), laptops and USB
          thumb drives loaded with presentation slide decks, and printed copies of the presentation and additional materials for your anticipated guests. </li>
</ul>

<p> Research America develops, conducts and disseminates marketing research programs for companies, and helps make data understandable for your organization through reporting and dynamic presentations. Our team will help your 
 marketing department interpret and integrate accurate and current marketing data into your programs, and help bring your ideas to market. </p>
