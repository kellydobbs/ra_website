	<p>“We are a world class marketing research firm that has worked with Research America for over 20 years. 
	  They continue to provide very high quality, low-cost, timely telephone interviews and we plan to use their 
    services in the years to come.” </p>
 
 <p>There are a lot of very capable research organizations that can give you quality, reliable and timely data but there are only a few that provide the interpretation and potential strategic uses of that information.  Rex and his team did a number of projects for General Motors over the years and their collaborative approach brought insightful and useable results. They are good listeners on the front end and are dedicated to making  sure they are asking the right questions and producing content with substance on delivery. </p>

<p>“I’ve worked with Research America since 1992, and I have always found Dave McGinley and his team friendly, 
cost efficient, and professional in all my dealings with them. They have fielded surveys for me with close to 30,000
 respondents over the years, and I continue to pick up the phone and call them when I need a survey done.” </p>

 No other research firm in the world could take on a survey at a moment’s notice and get the job done quickly,
  efficiently and productively. You are the best.” </p>

 <p>“The Research America team works the way we do, and cares about delivering the best possible value to clients.
     From the moment we begin a project, they manage it with the utmost care. They catch and correct questionnaire and
      sample errors that others might miss, and report cleaner, more accurate data. We work under tight deadlines here,
       so the time savings and quality assurance we receive from Research America is very valuable.” </p>
