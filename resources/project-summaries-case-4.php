	<br><strong> Project:</strong>		  
	 Food manufacturer – concept optimization</p>
	
	
		
	<h2>Background</h2>		
 <p>As part of its ongoing innovation strategy, a beverage manufacturer’s business team developed six new concepts designed to drive incremental volume and profit for the brand. Several of these concepts had tested well initially among a general population, but the brand believed taking them through a robust concept optimization phase with a focus on their key targets (African Americans, Hispanics, Young Adults, and Teens) could further strengthen them.</p>




<h2>Approach</h2>	
	
	<p>  RAI deployed a blended quant/qual hybrid methodology. This in-person, central location testing approach combined the confidence of quantitative with the depth and nuance of qualitative. Ideal for concept optimization, the approach allowed the client to confidently understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of each concept, but more importantly, what could be done to improve their overall performance. The real-time nature of the work provided the team with immediate results at sessions, as well as the insights necessary to refine and optimize the concepts going forward. </p>

	
	<h2>Results</h2>
	
	<p>Overall, two of the six concepts show strong, immediate potential for in-market success. Two other concepts represented an opportunity to stretch the brand in the future. The last two concepts needed significant adjustments before further consideration. Based on the learning from this research, the Brand will be conducting BASES* tests for the top scoring concepts.</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>BASES is a simulated test marketing system used to assess the volumetric potential of concepts and products prior to introduction.</p>
