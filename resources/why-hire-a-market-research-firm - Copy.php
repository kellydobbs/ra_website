<h1>5 Reasons You Should Hire a Market Research Firm	  </h1>
	<p>	Are you looking to identify new potential markets, launch the next great product, or target your ideal customers? If so, then market research is a logical next step. But if the data collection methods, a multitude of data to sift through, and <a href="../services/data-analysis-and-interpretation.php">interpretation and analysis </a>seem daunting, a market research firm can help you make sense of it all. We provide five reasons you should hire a market research firm to help guide your business decisions. </p>
	<p>
	  <span class="med-link">Save Time and Resources</span><br>
	  The first reason to hire a market research firm is to save your company valuable time and resources. Quality market research can be very complex and time-consuming. Most companies don’t have the staff or expertise to complete this work comprehensively, and costly mistakes may be made in the process. An expert market research firm will save you countless hours and complete the project efficiently. </p>
	<p><span class="med-link">Get to Know Your Customer in a Whole New Way<br>
	</span>	  When it comes to market research, it is beneficial to get an objective, fresh perspective. A market research company is completely neutral when conducting research and takes into consideration bias, flow, timing, and many other factors when building surveys and facilitating studies. Also, asking customers directly about their experience, for example, may not result in constructive feedback that is beneficial to your business. With anonymity, respondents are more likely to be open and honest with a third-party company. </p>
	<p><span class="med-link">Proven Methods That Result in Impactful Insights<br>
	</span>	  Do you know the right sample size for the best results? Or how to ask a question so that it’s interpreted the same way and yields consistently accurate answers? Should you conduct<a href="../Quantitative-Research.php"> quantitative </a>or<a href="../Qualitative-Research.php"> qualitative research</a>? These are just a few considerations market research firms take into account. A market research firm has time-tested methodologies, analytical tools, and best practices to reveal impactful market insights that answer your most important business questions.</p>
	<p><span class="med-link">Ensure Reliable Results<br>
	</span>	  Completing the market research data collection is only half of the project. The data needs to be accurately analyzed so that meaningful findings can be gleaned for your organization. This requires knowing how to edit, clean, and synthesize the data to produce reliable results. This information is converted into actionable insights to make smart, informed, and profitable business decisions. </p>
	<p><span class="med-link">A Credible Source to Support Claims<br>
		
	</span>	  Another reason to engage a market research firm is that your findings are viewed as more credible and trustworthy to your target audience. Claiming that your research conveniently proves your point might come across as self-serving or biased. But stating that “this research was conducted by XYZ, a market research company” bolsters the findings. <br>
