In reality, we have much more varied applications; businesses can use our image studies, needs assessments, or performance evaluations. Almost any industry could use our services; a retail company could test reactions to a new product line, an airport could poll public confidence, and travel agencies could tap into a niche market. We can work for every business, because every business depends on the customer opinion.</p>
