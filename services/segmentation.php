	<p>Research America’s consultant team provides insight into how your customers and potential customers
     make purchasing decisions by asking questions that sort answers into various market segment categories. 
     Our researchers next apply market segment analysis techniques to groups of your customers to help you 
    organize your marketing plan for each segment you want to target. </p>

<p>Marketers and marketing researchers typically segment consumers by these methods: </p>

<h3>Demographic Segmentation:</h3>
<p>Age, income, marital status, presence of children and other similar traits form demographic segments. 
Knowing your customer’s financial means and stage of life helps you offer products and services that have
 appeal and relevance to different demographic segments during different stages of their lives. </p>
  
  <h3>Geographic Segmentation:</h3>
  <p>Your target customer’s attitudes and needs vary according to where they live. Weather impacts sales of 
  different products in different regions. Personal values and attitudes also tend to dramatically vary by region,
   especially when we contrast urban areas versus rural areas, or examine political party membership across states, cities and towns, and even the individual neighborhoods where your products and services are sold. 
    Behavioral segmentation: Marketers review past purchase behavior and web browsing behavior to discover how your
    
 potential customers spend their money and what they’re buying, or want to buy. Past purchasing behavior and 
     website browsing data (including collecting website cookie data and examining abandoned online shopping cart
      content) highlight which customers are price-sensitive and which customers are more oriented by the premium 
      
      benefits your product or service offers. This data also clearly illustrates which customers are most loyal to
    your brand. </p>

   <h3> Customer Profitability: </h3>
  <p> You can prioritize target audiences for your marketing and advertising campaigns by 
    grouping your customers into categories that reflect how much each group contributes to your bottom line
     profitability. </p>
     
   <h3> Psychographic segmentation:</h3>
   <p> Marketers use psychographic information (observed traits and behaviors in 
    personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests, and lifestyles) to attempt to understand the needs 
    and attitudes of different customers and build messages and offers that will resonate with that segment.
     Marketers turn to their colleagues in marketing research to conduct studies that build psychographic
      segmentation profiles.</p>
   <p>  Research America’s consultants use this basic knowledge to help you better position your products 
    and develop different product lines to capture your market’s attention. As part of the research analysis
     phase of your study, our consultants will utilize marketing research segmentation analysis techniques to 
     identify which groups your customers and broader potential prospect base belong to.
