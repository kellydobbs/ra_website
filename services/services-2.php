	<h1>Market Research Services</h1>	

	
	
      <h2>Data Analysis and Interpretation </h2>
	          
	            <h2><a href="survey-study-design.php"> • Survey/ Study Design</a></h2>
	            <p>  Reliable research requires great organization - beginning with the design of each survey - to systematically collect data that describes, compares, and predicts attitudes, opinions, values, knowledge, and behavior. We work with client to develop a list of objectives and research goals, and then consult with clients in selecting a blend of methodologies and techniques to accomplish their objectives. </p>
             
	            <h2><a href="executive-summary.php"> • Executive Summary and Reporting</a></h2>
	             <p> At Research America, we provide highly-stylized charts and infographics that are delivered in a presentation-ready format for clients. Reports also include a narrative that summarizes key findings, statistically significant relationships, and next step recommendations. The narrative offers additional detail and context using common language to help clients apply data in meaningful ways. </p>
              
	            <h2><a href="on-site-presentation-and-reporting.php"> • On-Site Presentation</a></h2>
	             <p> In addition to receiving raw data and/or written reports, many clients need a live, in-person formal presentation of final project results to their organization. Research America&rsquo;s on-site meetings include a step-by-step review of study findings and results, and also provide the opportunity for direct questions-and-answers. Our expert team of statisticians, analysts, and strategists are always available to meet in-person and/or prepare formal, oral reports
	              as requested. </p>
	            <h2><a href="international.php"> • International</a></h2>
	              Besides domestic research, Research America also does work on an international scale. This includes<br/>
	              planning, design, and execution of the most appropriate in-market methodologies by our expert international research teams. </p><br>
	
	            <h2><a href="data-analysis-and-interpretation.php">Data Science </a></h2>
             
            
	        <p> Built on a culture of innovation, our data science team blends traditional marketing science methodologies such as conjoint, discrete choice, max-diff, and turf analysis with big data analysis, predictive analytics, and machine learning to provide robust answers to our client&rsquo;s most pressing questions. Our solutions are user friendly and actionable, commonly employing simulators and dashboards to answer any &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; questions brought up during the research. From pricing, to product and line optimization and customer segmentation, we apply rigorous statistics and a cutting- edge mindset to all of our data science projects. </p>

	            <h2><a href="interviewing.php">  • In-Depth Interviews (IDIs)</a></h2>
                        <p>  In-depth interviews with survey respondents are conducted either in-person or over the phone. IDIs are typically used during B2B interviews with respondents in high-level, or executive positions. The primary benefits to using IDI research is access to hard-to-reach respondents and generating detailed data from candid conversations. Interview responses are used to describe over-arching attitudes and opinions, and they add depth when incorporated into descriptive analysis for larger studies. </p>
	
		            <h2><a href="interviewing.php">  • Face to Face</a></h2>

              
<p>  Face to Face interviews are often used to obtain information that may be too sensitive to collect using other survey techniques. The primary benefit of using face-to-face interviewing is having an interviewer present, which establishes trust on the part of the respondent. Additionally, an interviewer is able to ask clarifying questions and incorporate visual aids to obtain more descriptive results. </p>
                     
            <h2><a href="on-site-presentation-and-reporting.php">  • Online Communities, Bulletin Boards, and Focus Groups</a></h2>
<p>  Private, online forums where invited users can share information, ideas, and opinions. Respondents receive invitations to log-in to answer questions on their own schedules. We provide trained online moderators, and clients can<br/>
                          observe results and print transcripts at any point during the study. These qualitative technologies bring the interactive advantages of focus groups or face-to-face IDIs to online research. </p>
							
                 <h2><a href="https://researchamericainc.com/about-us/research-america-team.php">• Moderating</a></h2>
     
                      
                       <p> Expert moderators independently probe respondents leading them through a nuanced pre-designed discussion guide. All Research America moderators are professionally trained and experienced, many with advanced degrees and over 15 plus years of experience in multiple disciplines such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, banking, packaged goods, IT, retail, agriculture, automotive, and many more.</p>
</p>
                      
<h2><a href="focus-groups.php">• Focus Groups</a></h2>
                          Focus groups are moderated conversations, typically conducted with 10-12 participants. While the research questions are scripted, responses are not. Moderators guide participants in a natural conversation, leveraging projective techniques about the subject of the study. It is recommended that individual opinions or ideas expressed in a study be used to describe a widely held opinion, and in some cases, the answers respondents provide may trigger new insights or ideas as part of a larger study. </p>
