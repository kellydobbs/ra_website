	<h1>Pharmaceutical Market Research</h1>
	<p>Closely tied to the healthcare industry, the pharmaceutical industry is also facing challenges, including pressure on drug pricing, regulation, changing healthcare models, and the growth of global drug manufacturing and sales. By 2024 the global pharmaceutical market is anticipated to grow to over US $1.3 trillion, with a CAGR of nearly 7%, and $500 billion in the U.S. alone.</p>

Research America regularly provides these insights to companies throughout the pharma industry, building a solid reputation for helping pharma companies succeed and grow.</p>
    
<h3>Research America has extensive experience and expertise in pharmaceutical market research, including:</h3>

<li>New product launch strategies</li>

	<h2>Introducing RxConnex<img  src="../_img/tm.png" width="20" height="20"> – a Powerful New Pharmacy Data Tool</h2>
	
	<h2>What is RxConnex<img  src="../_img/tm.png" width="20" height="20">?</h2>
	<p>A source for obtaining complete pharmacy records for study respondents. We have exclusive access to pharmacy records covering 85% of the US population. The service requires patient agreement and is HIPAA compliant. You will not receive any PHI as part of the process.</p>
	<h2>Why consider this service?</h2>
	<ul class="check">
	    <li>Our pilot studies confirm that, in many cases, the difference between patient-reported medical conditions, products taken, and levels of compliance and the facts is very large indeed. Particularly for studies involving complex and co-morbid conditions, RxConnex is an essential validation step.</li>
	    <li>We provide data and metrics including medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC) as well as persistence data</li>
	    <li>EMR data has been shown to be unreliable in terms of prescribed medicines and those actually taken by the patient.</li>
	    <li>EMR data is very costly to obtain. The cost of RxConnex data is low and will add very little to the cost of your project.</li>
	    <li>For smaller, qualitative studies, making sure you have the right patient respondents.</li>
	    <li>Tracking patients’ behaviors over time.</li>
	    <li>Adherence and/or compliance studies where patient-level data is critical to understanding patient behavior.</li>
	    <li>Show patterns in compliance or persistence over a period of time.</li>
	    <li>Follow specific patients and track their adherence and persistence.</li>
	    <li>HEOR data validation and insights in outcomes studies.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Valuable in:</h2>
	<ul class="check">
	    <li>Patient flow</li>
	    <li>Patient journey</li>
	    <li>Buying process</li>
	    <li>Patient segmentation</li>
	    <li>Research for adherence programs and support programs</li>
	</ul>
