<p>Robert Porter, RAI CEO is pleased to announce that as of July 1st <strong>we have merged                     Natural Marketing Institute (NMI) into our Research America Inc. family of companies. </strong>RAI was founded over 35 years ago and has grown to over 14 offices nationally with 300+ researchers.  Mr. Porter also confirmed that Research America Inc. and the Institute have been collaborative partners for the past few years. We have always shared a consistent vision for the Health and Sustainability consumer, and have dozens of high growth clients in common. So this announcement is a natural evolution of that strong alignment. By bringing together innovative leaders in Market Research and Consumer Insights &amp; Solutions, we are better positioned than ever to help B2B and CPG marketers acquire, grow and retain customers.<br><br>
