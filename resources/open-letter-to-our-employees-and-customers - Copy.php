<h1>An Open Letter to our Employees and Customers </h1>

	<p class="med-link"><em>To the Research America Community…</em> </p>

		


	
	<h2> We see you, we feel you, and we stand beside you.
 
</h2>

	
	<p>Research America was built on a strong base of core values. One team, relentless curiosity, choose kindness, integrity matters and customer first. In particular, “choose kindness” inherently represents inclusion and stands for equality. We represent many religions, gender affiliations, ages, and races. 

</p>
	

	<p>It is with great distress that I try to find the words, as some of our Research America community is wounded. We are a family, when one of us in pain, we all feel it.
</p>

	<p> More than 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that." And it resonates true again. Here at Research America, racial bias has no place. We work to support the elimination of systemic racism and inequality, while continuing to ensure opportunity is available to everyone. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”

  </p>
	
	
	
	
<p> Our leaders’ attention is on you, our team members and customers and your individual health and well-being. 
 </p>

	<p> Research America pledges that every team member has a platform to be heard. </p>

<p> Our goal as a company remains the same, to provide a working environment that is physically and emotionally safe for everyone. We pledge to continue our efforts to make Research America a place for all. As an international company, thank you to everyone for letting Research America be a part of your life. 
</p>

<p> While we continue to cope with uncertainty caused by Covid-19 and a constantly changing universe, we find ourselves in even greater emotional duress, as we stand by, or join our communities as we deal with injustice and racial inequality.
</p>

	<p> After all, isn’t it our diversity that makes us who we are? </p>
	<p class="med-link"> <em>Be safe. Be strong.</em>
</p>
