	<h2>Background</h2>		
 <p>A manufacturer was set to introduce a new product (PPI) and had developed several ads designed to ‘bring the product to life’. Objectives were to:


</p>
<ul check>
	<li>	Identify which, if any, of four designs achieves higher levels of purchase interest and likability over the Current design</li>
	<li>	Determine if any of the designs created greater breakthrough than the Current offering</li>


</ul>

<h2>Approach</h2>	
	
<p>An online package test was completed among 900 consumers who shop in the store chains that carry this private label brand.</p>


	
<h2>Results</h2>	
	<p>The findings helped provide the basis for an improved package design that exceeded their Current brand on critical dimensions:</p>
	<ul check>
	<li>	The brand is modern/contemporary</li>
	<li>	Helps me remember the brand</li>
	<li>	Is easy to find and recognize the brand in the store</li>
	<li>	Is a quality product</li>
	<li>Would come to the store to buy products from this brand.</li>
	</ul>
