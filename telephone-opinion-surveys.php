	<p>As technology increases, there have never been more ways to conduct marketing research. In addition to telephone opinion surveys and surveys conducted by mail or in-person interviews, marketing consultants have introduced internet polls and even text message polls to the various data collecting methods. Even with the thrust towards using new technology to make the marketing research process faster, companies still rely heavily on our services to inform them of consumer interests and emerging marketing trends.

</p>

	<p>Telephone opinion surveys remain a tried and true way to collect data for a number of reasons, even though internet poll s are gaining in popularity. Professionals recognize that they are still one of the best ways to represent the current population. Even though the telecom industry cites decreasing amounts of landline users and an increase in cell phone only households, we counteracted the trend by including cell phone users as well as landline users in samples. When taking into account both types of phone customers, we are able to accurately represent the general populationâ€™s interests.</p>



	<p>Telephone opinion surveys are one of the best ways for engaging consumer participation; even when 
    we attempt to measure statistical information about sensitive or taboo subjects, like addiction.
    Many kinds of research studies can be conducted anonymously, and respondents often feel free to 
    let interviewers know how they really think and feel in free-flow responses or through a range of
     coded responses. </p>



<p>We utilize live interviewers to help guide respondents through both simple and more complex surveys. Interviewers receive special training in how to conduct interviews, how to get through gate-keeping systems to reach potential respondents, and learn how to accurately re-frame questions to obtain useful responses. This ability 
to accurately probe makes our data more useful than flat or static data obtained via online polls.</p>


<p>We can accurately predict political elections, population trends, and changes in social values. 
In addition, we have shaped companies over the years, transforming products and bringing new ideas to the forefront. 
Their accuracy and ability to measure broad demographic outlooks ensure that telephone opinion surveys will 
have staying-power as a key marketing research tool.</p>
