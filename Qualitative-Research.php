	<h1>Qualitative Research</h1>
	
	
<p>Qualitative research is the best tool for getting a deep understanding of your consumers’ reasons, opinions, and motivations. This can provide insight into the specific research problem, or help you develop hypotheses for additional quantitative research. What’s most appealing about qualitative research is that it allows you to dig deeper and get beyond the surface level responses.
