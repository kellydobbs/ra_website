	<h1> Research America’s Recognized as a Top Cincinnati <br>Market Research Firm
	</h1>
		<em> Research America’s Cincinnati Location Ranks #22 on CBC Annual List </em><br>
		<p>
		The Cincinnati Business Courier announced its "Top Twenty-Five Marketing Research Companies" award on July 8 of this year and Research America was listed as the 22nd largest in the region.
			
	<p>More than sixty local marketing research businesses compete for projects in Greater Cincinnati and around the globe. The Business Courier ranked each business based on the number of local employees residing in the area. </p> 

	<p>Research America acquired Cincinnati-based Repass Research & Strategic Consulting in 2016.  The Repass firm first appeared in the Business Courier in 2012. </p>

<p>“It's an honor to be named to this list," commented Rex Repass, now President of Research America. "Our team is part of a great tradition of leading marketing research firms from the Cincinnati area.  We are pleased to be a part of the vibrant marketing research community in Cincinnati.”  

<p>Cincinnati is often recognized as the founding city for marketing research companies.  The profession has its roots in Cincinnati with the establishment of the first market research department by Procter & Gamble in 1922.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati Regional Chamber promotes the Queen City's role in creating some of the world’s most recognizable brands. P&G's pioneering work in 1922 spread new marketing and research methods worldwide. The company was founded in Cincinnati in the 19th Century and is the consumer products giant home today.   The region currently boasts the highest concentration of advanced brand consultancies and research firms in the world.</p>

<p>"The Research America team in Cincinnati deserves to be proud of this recognition," added CEO Robert Porter. "We’re proud to be a part of Cincinnati's historic marketing research community and tradition. We're helping our clients make brand-building decisions. The research we're doing on their behalf can turn any one of them into the next brand powerhouse." </p>
